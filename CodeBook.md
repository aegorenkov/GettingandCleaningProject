The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
>>>>>>> 45836af0f5cb6f3e94bc6ad59aaf76be64056844

subject: To identify which person is doing the activity out of a set 1-30
activity: One of six activities (1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING)

#The rest of the variables are means or standard deviations labelled as:
- mean(): Mean value
- std(): Standard deviation

of the additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

- gravityMean
- tBodyAccMean
- tBodyAccJerkMean
- tBodyGyroMean
- tBodyGyroJerkMean
