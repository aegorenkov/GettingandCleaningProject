The file tidy_data.txt contains our final dataset.

The columns are as follow:


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

subject: To identify which person is doing the activity out of a set 1-30
activity: One of six activities (1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING)

The rest of the variables are means or standard deviations labelled as:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

of the additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'Data/UCI HAR Dataset features.txt'
